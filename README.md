# odinTicTacToe

The task is to create a browser game of Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project comes following lessons on objects, object constructors, prototype objects and most recently factory functions and the module pattern; the intention of this project is to create a code with as little global code as possible, and to ultilize factory functions to the maximum. Taking time to focus and decide what logic must be in which functions will be important to me as to allow for all the logic to contianed within the respective factories for "game", "player", and "gameboard" - which are the suggested ones by the project brief.
An additional piece for this project is to possibly create different tiers for strength of opponent, starting initially with randomly placed peices on the availible tiles of the gameboard and ramping up to an AI which is actually unbeatable - the links for this algorithm are given by the breif.
This project will be utilizing: JS factory functions, JS module pattern, Game logic / Computer-game algorithms.
